                                    agree to this.</p>

                                <p>Once data is shared with the Medical Professional, it will remain shared
                                    between the Medical Professionals.</p>

                                <p>If at any time you are concerned about your, or your child's, care or the

                                    are presented to you, or (2) following your initial acceptance of terms during

                                <p>In addition to these Terms, SafeStart has established a Privacy Policy to
                                    explain how we collect and use information about you. You can review the
                                    Privacy Policy below. The Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into

                                <h4><b>Patient Responsibilities</b></h4>

                                <p>It is the responsibility of the patient to follow the advice of their
                                    Medical Professional and arrange any and all follow up in-office or online
                                    communication that is requested by the Medical Professional. If a follow up
                                    appointment is requested and the patient does not either schedule or maintain
                                    the appointment, or even if the patient does follow up, SafeStart is not
                                    liable for any delay in diagnosis or treatment.</p>

                                    medical condition, diet, fitness or wellness program. Never disregard
                                    professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of information you

                                <p>The Service requires you to register by creating a user account. You must

                                    means that you may not set up an account using someone else's name or contact
                                    information, unless you are a parent or legal guardian setting up and
                                    maintaining an account for your child, and in no event may you set up an
                                    account using a phony name or phony contact information. You also will be
                                    required to choose a password and/or a PIN. You are entirely responsible for
                                    safeguarding your password, PIN, and account, and you agree not to disclose
                                    your login information to any third party. Furthermore, you are entirely
                                    responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account, whether
                                    or not you authorized that activity. You agree to notify SafeStart

                                    security, by sending an email to contact@safestartmedical.com.</p>

                                <p>SafeStart will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result

                                    your knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by
                                    SafeStart or another party due to someone else using your account, PIN or
                                    password. You may not use anyone else's account at any time, without the
                                    permission of the account holder. You may not transfer your account to someone
                                    else. You will be liable for losses and damages incurred by us (or anyone else)
                                    due to the unauthorized use of your account.

                                <h4><b>Miscellaneous Legal Terms</b></h4>

                                <p>These Terms, together with any additional terms and conditions as indicated
                                    on the Site or via the Service, constitute the entire and exclusive agreement
                                    between you and SafeStart with respect to the Service, and supersede and
                                    replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the Service.
                                    These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. SafeStart's failure to
                                    enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision
                                    is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain
                                    in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our
                                    intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights in these
                                    Terms, and any such attempt is void, but SafeStart may assign its rights
                                    without restriction. SafeStart and you are not legal partners or agents;
                                    instead, our relationship is that of independent contractors.</p><br>

                                    electronic Communications, SafeStart will be deemed to have provided the

                                <p>If you would like to contact us to provide feedback, comments or requests
                                    for technical support, you should contact us through our customer support
                                    department at contact@safestartmedical.com</p>

                                <p>The below, Business Associate Agreement, binds only Covered Entities,
                                    including Medical Professionals and the health care organization to which they
                                    belong. The Business Associate Agreement does not apply to Users who are
                                    patients.</p>

                                <p>This is the standard Business Associate Agreement (BAA) that SafeStart
                                    offers to all Covered Entity Users. We are willing to negotiate terms of the
                                    Business Associate Agreement with any Covered Entity. In order to negotiate new
                                    terms to a BAA, we are willing to do so at an appropriate fee of no less than USD $5000.</p>

                                <p>We recognize that many Covered Entities have their own contracting
                                    requirements, and that our click-through BAA is not a one-size-fits-all
                                    document. We offer the ability for customers to negotiate our standard form BAA
                                    with us, within certain boundaries and on the terms and conditions set forth
                                    below. We will aim to be as flexible as we can, but we also recognize that,
                                    because of the wide variance in risk tolerances and different sensitivities
                                    attached to different types of health information, our product, and the terms
                                    under which it is offered, will not be suitable for all organizations. Subject
                                    to the payment of the $3,000 non-refundable fee, we will engage in good faith
                                    negotiations with you to put in place a BAA specific to your entity. However,
                                    as with any contractual negotiations, we cannot guarantee that an agreement
                                    will be reached.</p>
