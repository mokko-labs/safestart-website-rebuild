                                <h4><b>Security Overview</b></h4>

                                <p>SafeStart is compliant with HIPPA. We provide this overview so that you can
                                    better understand the security measures we've put in place to protect the
                                    information that you store using SafeStart.</p><br>

                                <h4><b>Secure Storage &amp; Reserved Instances</b></h4>

                                <p>All data stored in our databases is symmetrically encrypted using AES 256
                                    keys. Amazon Web Services stores data over several large-scale data centers.
                                    You can find more information about Amazon Web Services' security at the Amazon
                                    Web Services' website. Encryption keys are stored using further
                                    encryption.</p><br>

                                <h4><b>Secure Transfers</b></h4>

                                <p>Your files are sent from SafeStart's mobile and web apps to our servers
                                    over a secure channel using SSL encryption, the standard for secure Internet
                                    network connections.</p><br>

                                <h4><b>User Accounts</b></h4>

                                <p>User accounts are password protected. Upon successful entry of a unique
                                    email, password and authentication token, the user then gains access to his
                                    or her account.</p><br>

                                <h4><b>Your Data is Backed Up</b></h4>

                                <p>SafeStart and Amazon Web Services keep redundant backups of all data over
                                    multiple locations to prevent the remote possibility of data loss.</p><br>

                                <h4><b>Privacy</b></h4>

                                <p>We guard your privacy and work hard to protect your information from
                                    unauthorized access. Except as stated in the next sentence, SafeStart
                                    employees are prohibited from viewing the content of files you store in your

                                    including Patients' protected health information:</p>

                                    <li>to provide the Service</li>

                                    <li>to assemble Patients' health records</li>

                                <h4><b>How the Service facilitates your sharing of health information</b></h4>

                                <p>A key purpose of the Service is to facilitate the sharing by Patients of
                                    health information with Medical Professionals that are designated members of
                                    the Patient's health care team. </p>

                                <p>Patients share protected health information with designated Medical
                                    Professionals once they have established a Medical Professional - Patient
                                    relationship as outlined in our Terms of Service. Once data is shared it will
                                    remain shared with the Medical Professional.</p>

                                <p>No Medical Professional who accepts a sharing invitation has the ability to
                                    use the Service to share a Patient's health information with third parties, the
                                    exception being that Medical Professionals can use or disclose protected health
                                    information, such as X-rays, laboratory and pathology reports, diagnoses,
                                    photos, videos, and other medical information for treatment purposes only
                                    without the patient's authorization. This includes sharing the information to
                                    consult with other providers, including providers who are not covered entities,
                                    to treat a different patient, or to refer the patient.</p><br>

                                <p>The Service is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. A
                                    parent or guardian can create a Profile for a child and grant others access to
                                    the data. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has
                                    provided us with personally identifying information without their consent, he
                                    or she should contact us at contact@safestartmedical.com. If we become aware that a

                                    steps to delete such information from our files.</p><br>

                                <h4><b>Patient Rights to Protected Health Information (PHI)</b></h4>

                                <p>You have a right to:</p>

                                <p>1. View your medical records. You can access your medical records that have
                                    been provided to SafeStart within 30 days of your request to do so. You can
                                    view your medical records at any time by accessing your account online.</p>

                                <p>2. Inspect and copy your PHI. You must submit your request to inspect or
                                    copy your PHI online to SafeStart. SafeStart may impose a fee for the
                                    costs of copying, mailing, labor and supplies associated with your request.
                                    SafeStart may deny your request to inspect and/or copy your PHI in certain
                                    limited circumstances. If that occurs, SafeStart will inform you of the
                                    reason for the denial, and you may request a review of the denial.</p>

                                <p>3. Amend your PHI. If you believe your file is incomplete or incorrect, you can request that SafeStart add an addendum to your PHI. SafeStart may, under certain circumstances, deny your request. If that occurs, you have the right to submit a statement of disagreement for inclusion in your records. You cannot change any PHI after the information has been used for the completion of a surgical safety time out.</p>

                                <p>If you cancel your operation your information remains part of the the medical record and we will keep the information as long as specified by the law.</p>

                                <p>4. Accounting and disclosures. You always have the decision whether or not
                                    to give permission for your PHI to be shared before it is used or shared. Your
                                    chosen health professionals that use the Service are prohibited from using or
                                    sharing your personally identifiable medical records for any purposes that are
                                    not part of normal, routine health care processes. You have the right to
                                    receive an accounting of all disclosures SafeStart has made of your PHI.
                                    Accordingly, upon request, made in a 12 month period SafeStart shall provide
                                    the patient, at no charge, with a copy of accounting of disclosures.</p>

                                <p>SafeStart will provide you a notice that tells you how your PHI has been
                                    used and shared. This accounting will be provided without charge for the first
                                    request made in a 12-month period. Reasonable cost-based charges can be imposed
                                    to provide an additional accounting(s) if the request for the 2nd (3rd...)
                                    accounting is within the 12 month period, as permitted by law.</p>

                                <p>5. Complaint. You may complain to SafeStart and to the Secretary of the
                                    Department of Health and Human Services if you believe that your privacy rights
                                    have been violated.</p>

                                <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at
                                    contact@safestartmedical.com.</p>
